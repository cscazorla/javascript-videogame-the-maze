# The maze
Everytime the game is loaded a new maze is generated using the simple [Depth-first search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Depth-first_search):

1. Start at a random cell.
2. Mark the current cell as visited, and get a list of its neighbors. For each neighbor, starting with a randomly selected neighbor:
    - If that neighbor hasn't been visited, remove the wall between this cell and that neighbor, and then recurse with that neighbor as the current cell.
